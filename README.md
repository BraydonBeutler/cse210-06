# MINE SWEEPER
Minesweeper is the classic game. Figure out which tiles are bombs, and flag them. The game ends when you flag all (and only) the mines, or if you accidentally uncover one X_X.
Commands:
	"F" -> Flag a tile
	Spacebar -> Reveal a tile
	Left/right/up/down -> left right up and down, respectively :p
